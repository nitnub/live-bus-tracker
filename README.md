# Real Time Bus Tracker

This is a basic bus stop tracker for the Seattle and Boston areas. Jump between the two maps by clicking the link at the top-right of the screen. Note that you will need a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API key in order to view the maps. 

* Seattle: Select a line from the drop-down to view all available stops. Each stop is clickable and will tell you the intersection / stop name.

* Boston: Click the button at the top-left of the screen to update the marker location.

## How to Run
To run this project, simply navigate to [https://nitnub.github.io/live-bus-tracker](https://nitnub.github.io/live-bus-tracker/) and follow the instructions on the page.


## Future Improvements
* Expand bus positioning functionality for both cities.
* Enhance with bootstrap.
* Add dark mode.
