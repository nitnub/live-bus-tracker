# Real Time Bus Tracker

This is a basic bus & bus stop tracker for the Boston and Seattle areas, respectively. Jump between the two maps by clicking the link at the top-right of the screen. Note that you will need a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API key in order to view the maps. 

* Seattle: Enter your Mapbox key and select a line from the drop-down to view all available stops. Each stop is clickable and will tell you the intersection / stop name.

* Boston: Enter your Mapbox key and click the button at the top-left of the screen to begin live tracking of all buses traveling the route 1 line which connects MIT and Harvard. All data updates every 10 seconds.


## How to Run
To run this project, simply navigate to [https://nitnub.github.io/live-bus-tracker](https://nitnub.github.io/live-bus-tracker/) and follow the instructions on the page.


## Roadmap of Future Improvements
* Expand bus tracking functionality to the Seattle map.
* Add stops to the Boston map.
* Enhance with bootstrap.
* Add dark mode.
